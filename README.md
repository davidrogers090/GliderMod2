# GliderMod2

A Vintage Story mod that overhauls the glider's physics to provide a more intuitive, responsive, and exhilarating flight experience.

---

### Why This Mod?

The vanilla Vintage Story glider, while a great addition, can sometimes feel a bit sluggish or unpredictable. This mod aims to fix that by giving you more control over your descent and direction, making soaring through the valleys and over the peaks of Vintage Story feel less like a controlled fall and more like true flight.

### Key Features

* **Responsive Control:** Pitching up and down has a more immediate but slower descent rate. Gives a better soaring experience and prevents abusing it for jumps.
* **Enhanced Maneuverability:** Adjust your direction mid-air with greater precision.
* **Smoother Experience:** The new physics model reduces the "mushy" feel, making gliding a satisfying and consistent form of travel.
* **Dynamic Gliding:** Find a new balance between diving for speed and pulling up for distance.

### Compatibility

This mod modifies the vanilla glider's core behavior. It should be compatible with most other mods, but may conflict with any mod that also directly alters glider physics.

---

### Roadmap

* Add a configuration file to allow players to fine-tune the glider's physics to their liking.
* Make this version a separate item with a more difficult build tree.
